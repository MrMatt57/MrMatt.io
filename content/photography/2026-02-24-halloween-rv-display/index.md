description: "Someone took the concept of a mobile home and decided to make it absolutely *haunt* the neighborhood—this RV is giving full Halloween energy with its neon purple glow and skeleton crew. It's the kind of committed seasonal decoration that makes you respect the homelab tinkering mindset, just applied to holiday LED coordination."
