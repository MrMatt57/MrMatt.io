This page is a snapshot of what I'm focused on right now. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com).

## Work

Building things with cloud infrastructure and AI.

## Side Projects

Rebuilding this site from the ground up with Hugo and Cloudflare Pages.

[PitClaw](https://github.com/MrMatt57/pitclaw) — a spec-driven, agentic engineering project where the software, hardware design, and 3D-printed enclosure are all AI-generated from specs — no code written by hand. ESP32-based smoker controller with a touchscreen web UI, predictive temperature modeling, and a passion for barbecue holding it all together.

## Interests

Rowing, coffee, cooking, and the occasional homelab tinkering.
