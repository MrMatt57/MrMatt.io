I'm Matt Walker — an engineer, builder, and serial hobbyist based in the Baltimore/DC Metro area. I spend my professional life working at the intersection of data and AI, and the rest of it picking up hobbies faster than I can put them down.

### Work

I help organizations build enterprise data platforms and AI-capable infrastructure — semantic data models, agentic automation, and the tooling that ties it all together. The goal is always the same: help businesses get the most value out of their technology, from analytics and machine learning to AI agents and beyond.

### Hobbies

I've never been able to stick to just one thing. Over the years I've built and flown RC planes, brewed all-grain beer, restored tractors, modified cars for the drag strip, built a retro arcade cabinet, turned wooden bowls on a lathe, tumbled rocks, and dialed in a lawn care program that the neighbors quietly resent. These days it's a lot of camping, traveling, and dragging the family to national parks. I row on a Concept2 for health and sanity, and I've been on the water enough to justify keeping a boat around.

Coffee found me later in life and I went all in. I roast single-origin beans at home, obsess over roast profiles, and brew every way I can — espresso on a Gagiuino-modded Gaggia Classic, pourovers on a V60, batch brews on a Moccamaster, and the trusty AeroPress for travel. Full coffee nerd, no apologies.
