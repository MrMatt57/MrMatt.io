Welcome.

If you are reading this post, the migration is complete. As promised, an all new site, with all new content.

With this much needed upgrade, I chose Linode.com as a host. They have many distros to choose from and a great management console. I am also partial to hosting facilities located in Texas for the geographic advantages. In the migration, I implemented Amazon S3 storage for all my static files. I have also scratch built a wordpress theme with minimalist styling and speed in mind. I still have a lot of tweaking to go, but it was time for launch.
