![Windows Vista SP1 Complete](http://static.mrmatt57.org/img/vista_sp1.jpg)

I just installed Windows Vista SP1 and so far have noticed quite a performance improvement. Nothing scientific here- just -click of the mouse- impressions. But everything seems more responsive and smooth. One tangible difference is network file transfers. While moving files, pre-SP1 to a network drive I would get consistently 25mb/sec. Now the same transfer is moving along at 32mb/sec. Again, nothing concrete, but that is a 28% improvement. This is just one of the [notable changes](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/4/a/f4a35b2b-2f62-4104-a3e6-5f7bc1318e9f/Notable%20changes%20in%20Windows%20Vista%20SP1.pdf) in SP1.

I have always enjoyed vista. There are a lot of XP die hards out there, understandably not wanting to upgrade. I built a new computer when I migrated to vista, so I didn-t feel the impact as much. The benefits have been great; environment is pleasurable and reliability has been top notch. I picture the trade offs like this-. sure windows 98se was faster than XP on the same hardware . It-s only natural that XPsp2 will be faster than Vista on the same hardware. Every OS has it-s issue, even the prim and proper Apple got slammed for [Leopard bugs](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/11/this-cat-has-fl.html). Change always brings new issues, but it also bring good.

I have to thank Microsoft for this service pack. Yes, I know- they technically fixed something that was -broken-. But, it isn-t often that you see this noticeable of a performance gain without upgrading hardware or bumping your vcore.

Installation was flawless, 32 minutes on [my system](http://mrmatt57.org/2007/12/08/my-rig/). (i twitter-logged it)

I [downloaded](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/bb898842.aspx) the stand-alone update via MSDN. Microsoft is expected to [push the release date](http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Microsoft-Bows-to-Business-Pressure-for-Earlier-SP1-Release-61643.html?welcome=1203142244) up to late February as apposed to mid March. If you wait for automatic updates to kick in, you won-t get it until mid April.

I am quite happy.
