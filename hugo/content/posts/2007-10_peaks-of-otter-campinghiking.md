Jaimie and I went camping at Peaks of Otter on the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia last weekend. We tent camped at site #21 and Hikes around the lake the first evening. It was a beautiful day and was quite crowded around the lodge. The park is very well maintaned and the staff is very friendly. This was the first trip with our new Mountain Hardware Casa 4 tent. Setup time is a about 2 minutes more than the average tent, but worth the effort. The design offers a roomy interior with a spacious gear vestibule. The next morning we woke up and hiked the sharp top mountain trail. We just about had the trail to ourselves on the way up. At the top, we ran into a group that took the bus up. The views are sweet, you can see a complete 360 degrees. It is also worth the trip over to Buzzards Roost. There are some cool climbing rocks and more breath taking views. Here are some pics:
