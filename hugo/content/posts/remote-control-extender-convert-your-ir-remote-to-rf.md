Are you sick of playing target practice with your remote controls?

I tried several -remote control extenders-. Most of them relayed the infrared signal from one room to another. You still had to point the remote at the sensor and in most cases aim it. When I stumbled across the [Next Generation Remote Control Extender](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C1Z0HA?ie=UTF8&tag=matwalstecand-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000C1Z0HA)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matwalstecand-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000C1Z0HA) I was skeptical. -You put the what where?- Yes- you put a Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter in place of one of the batteries in your Infrared (IR) remote. Don-t ask me how the thing works, but it transmits the signal to the odd looking receiver in the other room. At first I thought the receiver was battery powered. But it comes with an AC Adapter and actually charges the second smaller battery that powers the transmitter. This way you always have a battery ready to go, brilliant.

I am currently using Microsoft-s Media Center [Remote Control](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00066FIO6?ie=UTF8&tag=matwalstecand-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00066FIO6)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matwalstecand-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00066FIO6) and [Keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AOAAN8?ie=UTF8&tag=matwalstecand-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000AOAAN8)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matwalstecand-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000AOAAN8) with it and that they both work WAY better. I was on the verge or replacing the keyboard because you really had to point it to have fluid mouse movements. Now both remotes work on command and flawless in any room in my house!

- Super easy to setup.
- Works like any RF remote, no direct line of sight required, thought walls - up to 100? away
- 433.92 MHz - seems like a good frequency with little or no perceived interference.

Cons:

- I have heard it doesn-t work with all remotes, but it has worked with ever one I have tried.
- Battery doesn-t last long with one battery remotes.

Conclusion:

The technology and engineering behind this device is award winning. It does exactly what it claims to do, convert almost any IR remote to RF. I have been using it for about a month with great success!
