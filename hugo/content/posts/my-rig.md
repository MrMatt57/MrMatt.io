<noscript>[![](http://static.mrmatt57.org/img/2218793987.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/matt-walker/2218793987/)</noscript>People have been asking what I am running for my current system so here is a post dedicated to just that. Several of the components have been carried over from many configurations ago. I have been through many iterations and a lot of research to derive this system. Suggestions and Questions are welcome, please comment.
