I have been researching the different models of AirHogs and it is quite difficult to see what they actually offer. The AirHogs site is horrible. All I have to say is infomercials and the web don-t mix. They just don-t have any information on the different models. It appears that all of the ones setup with the two props are the AeroAce model. They have a BiPlane, Jet and Diamond Aircraft look alike. I have found that the other models are no good. I tried the F-22 -Park- jet and it was not much fun. It used a weird pulse for throttle control/roll and the aerodynamics/glide were really non-existent. Estes makes a few nice models, but steer clear of the larger -Park- fliers. Stick with the ones labeled -Backyard-.
