It was two years ago since I made my last [website update](/posts/website-update-2014/). I moved the site from a custom hosted Wordpress framework over to Ghost.  I was and still am interested in full stack javascript solutions.  It was no lack of the platform for not keeping things updated, I just didn't have time to post.  I plan to change that this year, with a new an improved [website stack](/stack/) built on Hugo with a solid [open source](https://github.com/MrMatt57/MrMatt57.org) based devops toolchain.

Building on the last website update, my focuses are:

- **Standards Based Markup/Content**
    - Better Semantic Markup
    - Follow WCAG 2.0 AA Guidlines
- **Better DevOps**
    - Github
    - Travis-ci
    - Accessabilty Testing
    - Branch based Deployments
- **Even Lighter and Faster**
	- Static files built with Gulp and Hugo
    - No JQuery
    - No Bootstrap
    - Javascript not required

These are just a few areas of improvement. Keep an eye on the sites [stack](/stack/) page for a full listing of what makes the new site run.
