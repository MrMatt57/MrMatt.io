This one is really digging into the archives- Here are some pictures and specs of my first car (not my parent-s station wagon). I learned a lot and have many great memories from this car. I often joked, that I literally turned every bolt on this car. I didn-t have access to air tools either, all old fashion Craftsman hand tools. There where many long cold nights completing mods so that I would be ready to drive to work the next day. I wish I had better pictures, but here they are (Mostly scanned 35mm, if I find the original print/negatives, I will rescan).
