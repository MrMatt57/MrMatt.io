I have been looking around for a good secure USB key/Software solution for quite awhile. I have used TrueCrypt for years and it works great for what it does. But I wanted more. One watch of the IronKey demo and believe me, you will want one.

Everything I read for the most part was good. Now that I have the device I must agree, it is a great solution to many peoples problems. My only gripe is that you can-t add shortcuts to the management interface. Not a big deal, but makes the interface pretty useless besides manageing the device, backups, etc. If you are looking for a USB drive to carry on your keychain everywhere you go- this might currently be your best solution. Here are some pictures of the drive.<center>[![IronKey](http://static.mrmatt57.org/img/ironkey/ironkey1_thumb.jpg "IronKey")](http://static.mrmatt57.org/img/ironkey/ironkey1.jpg) [![IronKey](http://static.mrmatt57.org/img/ironkey/ironkey3_thumb.jpg "IronKey")](http://static.mrmatt57.org/img/ironkey/ironkey2.jpg)

I will post my current workstation specs soon.
