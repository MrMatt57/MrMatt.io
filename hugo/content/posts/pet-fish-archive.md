I have had pet fish on and off ever since I can remember. I don-t currently have fish, but can-t wait to setup another tank. Here are some of my recent tanks.


## Three Red Belly Piranhas

I started these fish in a 20 gallon long aquarium while I was waiting for the biomass to build in the 55 gallon. They were the size of a quarter when I bought them. They eventually outgrew the 55 gallon and I had to return them to the fish store. They were a lot of fun, but also a lot of work.

## First Saltwater Tank

This tank was started with a variety of damsels and later the home for a maroon clown, coral beauty and a crab.

## Scooby the Guppy

This fish was amazing, she lived to be one and a half years old! She started her life as a feeder fish for my red belly piranhas. She found a comfortable hiding spot between one of the logs and a plant and managed to survive for almost a month. She deserved a home of her own. I moved her into a 5 gallon tank where she somehow managed to give birth to 5 babies! This was truely a miracle fish. She ultimately died of natural causes.
