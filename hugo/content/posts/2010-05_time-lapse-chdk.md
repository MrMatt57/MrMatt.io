I don-t know what it is about them, but time lapse videos captivate me. It might be the fact that you can live hours in minutes? Maybe in a strange way it is gratifying to watch life pass by without consequences? Whatever it is, they are a lot of fun to watch- and now create!

When I found out I could use my [Canon A2000is](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4BZE?ie=UTF8&tag=matwalstecand-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001EQ4BZE)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matwalstecand-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001EQ4BZE) point and shoot to create a time lapse, i was floored. I owe it all to the [Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK)](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK). With this nifty piece of software, your Canon camera can boot a whole new feature set from an SD card. Most importantly, run [Ultra Intervalometer script](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/UBASIC/Scripts:_Ultra_Intervalometer).

One gotcha with CHDK is that it will only boot from a FAT16 partition. So if you have a 4gig+ SD card, you will need to jump through some hoops to create a bootable FAT16 (32mb will do) and a larger FAT32 partition for storage. MacOS and Linux read the partitions no problem, if you are using Windows- [SDM Installer](http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/sdm/quick.htm) will help you create and switch between partitions.

The next thing you need is power, after all your wimpy lithium-ion or in my case NiMH-s won-t last all day. This is where an AC Adapter comes in. Mine didn-t come with one, so I found a [HQRP AC Replacement Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr%5Fnr%5Fp%5F6%5F0%26keywords%3Dcanon%2520ac%2520adapter%26bbn%3D13535471%26qid%3D1274497082%26rnid%3D303116011%26rh%3Dn%253A502394%252Cn%253A172435%252Cn%253A13535371%252Cn%253A13535471%252Ck%253Acanon%2520ac%2520adapter%252Cp%5F4%253AHQRP%252Cp%5F6%253AA3IZHOEADOGAP0&tag=matwalstecand-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matwalstecand-20&l=ur2&o=1) for my camera. Get the one with the transformer in the middle, it has a longer cord.

Once you get all your images together, you need to [make the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcYBMK0aweM). For this I used Quicktime 7 Pro. It was super easy and imported directly to iMovie for transitions, audio and text. When creating the video, I used the default 15fps photo sequence.

It-s hard to believe that my sub $200 [Canon A2000IS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4BZE?ie=UTF8&tag=matwalstecand-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001EQ4BZE)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=matwalstecand-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001EQ4BZE) camera is capable of such amazing things. Many more to follow, stay tuned.

Just remember- time is relative.
