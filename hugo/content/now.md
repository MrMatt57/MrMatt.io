There is an FT-450AT, G5RV and MFJ-939Y on there way across the country headed for my doorstep! Â Finally setting up my first HF rig.

Lots of Tiny Whooping, videos to come.

Planning to assimilate the winter Mystery Tackle Box collection and start to get ready for the Liberty Reservoir spring fishing.
