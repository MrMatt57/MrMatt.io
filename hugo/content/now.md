HF rig is setup!  G5RV is in the trees, making contacts up and down the coast and into the midwest.  Mostly working PSK31 on 40m and having a blast!  Just got in a used Cushcraft R8 and trying to figure logistics on how to put it up!

Still Tiny Whooping and getting better a flying acro.  

Ready for fishing already!  Tackle is prepped, fresh line is spooled, batteries are charged and stickers are up-to-date.  Missed a few windows to hit Liberty, the water is LOW.  First above freezing weekend and it is on.
