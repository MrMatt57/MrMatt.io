Thinking about a few home automate posts to add to the site.

Built my first Tiny Whoop and started flying it with a cobbled together 5.8ghz receiver and OTG video capture and Google Daydream.

Passed my third and final exam for MCSD: Azure Solution Architect!  I can add that to my MCSD: Web Applications and MCSD: Visual Basic 6 :)

New domain, moving from mrmatt57.org to mrmatt.io.  Just another piece of modernizing and [updating my site](https://mrmatt.io/posts/website-update-2016/).
