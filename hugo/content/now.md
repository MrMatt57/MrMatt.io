Right now, I am working on re-doing my site and learning about some cool web development toolchains.

I am looking forward to the holidays so that I have more time to tinker and get my content cleaned up.

Really diggin' Key CDN and still happy with DNSMadeEasy.  I updated my wife's business website [healthystartchildcare.com](https://healthystartchildcare.com) to use the stack too!.
