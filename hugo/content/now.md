In the planning stages for an Arcade cabinet!  So far what I have planned; 2 player stand up, 40" screen, x-arcade byo kit w/ older quadcore PC.  More to come!

Fishing: Great fishing on Liberty, no trophies yet this year but lots of healthy fish.  

Amatuer Radio: Still primarily having fun working JT65 and PSK31.  Listened to a few SO-50 passes and doing some research on building dual-band unis.  Hope to get my first sat contact soon.

Quads: Was having fun flying the x220 Wizard until I crashed and burned out one of the escs. I tried to replace it but, can't find an compatible match, so another x220 is on a slow boat and I'll have plenty of parts going forward :)
