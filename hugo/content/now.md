Happy New Year!

Had a wonderful holiday break, enjoyed some needed r&r and worked on this site a bit.  

I originally brought over Disqus comments, but realized how chatty and bloated they were.  I also really wanted to make the site single orgin with no trackers and nasty scripts.  They also broke numerious WCAG2.0AA rules, so bad I had to disable some checks.   Well... they are gone.  Staticman to the rescue!
