Fishing: Few trips fishing on Liberty, the water levels are low.  It has been interesting to see the structure and correlating it to where I have caught fish.  If I was smart I would set some waypoints.   Water temps are just getting up into the 60s and the fish are moving up!

Amatuer Radio: Still having fun working JT65 and PSK31.  Thinking about either kitting my setup in a go box or looking into a mobile HF rig so I can work HF from multiple locations.

Quads: Just got my first micro, an eachines Wizard x220 via a slow boat from China. Been flying LOS until I get comfortable with the rates.  It has way more power than the Tiny Whoops.  Can't wait to get to a park to really flex it.
