+++

My name is Matt Walker, I'm a web developer and technology enthusiast. I am also a hobbyist with interests in radio controlled airplanes, amateur radio and the great outdoors.

I currently live in [Taylorsville, MD](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=taylorsville,+MD&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=l1P3S7j8D5u0zASv09GEDg&amp;ved=0CBIQpQY&amp;view=map&amp;geocode=FVgUWgIdSMBn-w&amp;split=0&amp;sll=39.457880,-77.086648&amp;sspn=0.000000,0.000000&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Taylorsville,+Carroll,+Maryland&amp;ll=39.460385,-77.086687&amp;spn=0.037109,0.077162&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A) and work primarily in the greater Baltimore and Washington DC area.</a>.

## Why MrMatt57?
The short answer; this is my handle online. Mister Matt has been a given nickname for years and has stuck. I am not quite sure where the number 57 came from, it has always stood out in my mind since childhood. Ketchup marketing maybe?

## What is MrMatt57.org?
This is my forum to share and acquire knowledge.

## I need some help, can I hire you?
I am currently **unavailable** for full-time work.

On occasion I take on side projects. If you have something interesting
for me to work on, reach out. Even if I can't participate, I might know someone who can.
