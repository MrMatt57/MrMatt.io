<h2>Why MrMatt57?</h2>
The short answer; this is my handle online. Mister Matt has been a given nickname for years and has stuck. I am not quite sure where the number 57 came from, it has always stood out in my mind since childhood. Ketchup marketing maybe?

<h2>What is MrMatt57.org?</h2>
This is my forum to share and acquire knowledge.

<h2>I need some help, can I hire you?</h2>
I am currently <strong>unavailable </strong> for full-time work.

On occasion I take on side projects. If you have something interesting
