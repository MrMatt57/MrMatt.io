    <p>@Bob - That is a really good question.  I think I would lean towards conservation.  I see technology almost as a band-aid to our problems; conservation seems to get more at the root.   It still takes energy/resources to make technology, sometimes more:</p><p>“As Matt Power notes in this month's issue of Wired, hybrids get great gas mileage but it takes 113 million BTUs of energy to make a Toyota Prius. Because there are about 113,000 BTUs of energy in a gallon of gasoline, the Prius has consumed the equivalent of 1,000 gallons of gasoline before it reaches the showroom. Think of it as a carbon debt -- one you won't pay off until the Prius has turned over 46,000 miles or so.” - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5jwkuu" rel="nofollow noopener">http://tinyurl.com/5jwkuu</a></p>
