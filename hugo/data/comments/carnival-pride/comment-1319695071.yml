    <p>I get motion sick very easy and was worried too.  I took Dramamine for the first day, but found I didn't need them.  The ships are HUGE and have very little motion, plus there is so much to do to take your mind off of it.  They make it very easy to relax and have a good time!  Enjoy the trip!</p>
