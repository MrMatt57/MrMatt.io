message: "First off I want to say terrific blog! I had a quick question in which I'd like to ask if you do not mind. I was interested to know how you center yourself and clear your mind before writing. I've had a difficult time clearing my mind in getting my ideas out. I do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or tips? Thank you!\r\neducational websites for students http://educationpoints.eu/"
