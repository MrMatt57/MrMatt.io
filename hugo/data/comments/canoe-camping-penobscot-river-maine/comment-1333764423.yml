    <p>Hi Matt - just watched your 2009 video on youtube of your camping trip on the west branch of the penobscot.  I grew up in Maine and spent lots of time in Baxter - live now in MA - but am planning a trip very similar to yours - probably solo - this September.  Just wanted to thank you for the great video - can't wait to get out there.</p><p>I've been in contact with a couple of outfitters regarding shuttle service - Katahdin Outfitters no longer provides shuttles - I plan on meeting my shuttle service at the ranger station, he'll then ride with me in my vehicle to Lobster Stream put-in and take my vehicle back to the Ranger station.</p><p>Any advice, tips from your trip??</p><p>Thanks,<br>Bob Patten<br>Franklin, MA</p>
