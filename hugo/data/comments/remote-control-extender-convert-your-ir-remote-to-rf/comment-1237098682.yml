    <p>Still working great!  A technician was out today to fix a cable signal issue and gave me some "cool points" for the converter.  He said, "I am definitely going to get one".  My video card couldn't take the 1920x1080 heat and fried, until the new card comes in, I am stuck with my xbox360 extender and the cable boxes.</p>
