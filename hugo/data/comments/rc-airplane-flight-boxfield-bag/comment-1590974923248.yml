message: "Hopes of ecological recovery from coal mine collapse rise after tragedy\n\nSawyer County commissioners are preparing for a possible explosion of an abandoned mine after the discovery of a huge underground shaft containing more than 100 million tons of coal.\n\n\"This is the worst natural disaster we've seen in our county's history, and it's going to happen again,\" said Bob Davis, commissioner of the Somerset County Environmental Commission.\n\nThe area was the site of one of the biggest natural disasters in US history, which could be the result of a natural disaster. The mine shaft, estimated to be between 10 and 15 miles underground, was discovered about four weeks ago and excavated by the company Black Diamond Exploration. There are plans to recover hundreds of thousands of tons of coal from the shaft, which is the largest of its kind in North America.\n\nHowever, the miners' rights group Environmental Defense Fund, as well as the New Jersey Alliance for Deep Water, fear the recovery is the start of a dangerous process. And if it doesn't stop this summer, \"you're going to see a whole lot more of it,\" Davis said.\n\nThe mine is estimated to be filled with enough waste coal from more than 2.4 million tons of coal from around the US and Europe, to yield about 15 million tons of contaminated coal, or a quarter of the US coal supply. Black Diamond has been able to recover about 65 percent of the contaminated coal.\n\nThe company's new plan is to shut down the mines, which would cause the plant to lose about 300 jobs in an area of southeastern Pennsylvania with more than 20 percent poverty.\n\nThe company is trying to find a way to stop the tailings, which would release more radioactive material, such as strontium-90, into the air, and thus the surrounding community. The company is also developing an underground nuclear waste treatment facility, where it hopes to store nuclear waste underground while it's burning the coal in the tunnels to keep temperatures down.\n\n\nEnvironmentalists say the company can do no more than protect its customers and that it shouldn't be able to bury or reprocess the radioactive waste in a deep underground mine. They're calling on officials to make changes to the coal ash disposal standards to limit radioactive contamination.\n\n\nCoal ash â€” a byproduct of burning coal â€” should be treated as hazardous waste and not dumped underground, Davis said.\n\nThe explosion\n\nIt took four hours for the explosion in the mine shaft to cause an explosion. The shaft is buried in a deep pit, about six feet beneath the surface. The area will remain largely intact for years because of the site's natural, and therefore dangerous, conditions.\n\nCleaning and excavation of the shaft was completed within the last six months, but no concrete floor, steel frames o \r\n[url=https://www.uzgitwebtasarim.com/]더킹카지노[/url]\r\nï»¿[url=https://www.prakritikolkata.com/]온카지노[/url]\r\n \r\nCouncil considers time frame for swim centre\n\nThe City of Hamilton is looking at ways to add swim centres to the parks.\n\nIt has already created five new centres in Hamilton City Council parks with a total of 14 swim centres.\n\nCoun. Michael Thompson said there needs to be a larger pool and bigger areas to accommodate the number of kids.\n\n\"We need a pool that is a little bit bigger that has a longer length. We need to get the water up there to a certain height as well,\" he said.\n\nThe City of Hamilton is proposing to build two pools and one marina in the Hamilton Parks and Recreation Centre.\n\nA proposal was made to build two pools at the Hamilton City Park site that would open in December 2017.\n\nThe plan is to move forward with the addition of one more pool and marina after an initial design review which was completed in September."
