Each of us believed in Santa Claus, but no matter how old we are today, we are still spellbound, watching the magician and can not take our eyes off his hands that carry magic. What is the secret of this mysterious magic? It is considered that magic is a special art form based on the skill and high professionalism of the magician. It is akin to magic, for it misleads us with its fantastic complexity. \r\nIt is known that magic tricks were popular in ancient times. The earliest evidence dates back to 1700 BC. The ancient Greeks and Romans loved to watch tricks, especially those that used various hidden mechanisms. With the help of these mechanisms, magicians performed real miracles: the huge doors of temples opened by themselves, wine poured from the hands of marble statues. What did not magicians invent to win over their insatiable audience?! And the audience understood that often under the supernatural miracle is sleight of hand, and called resourceful artists illusionists, since the term \"illusio\" in Latin means delusion, deception. \r\nIn the modern world, focus is presented as a circus genre, which is based on demonstrating the appearance, disappearance, movement of objects, as well as changes in their shape, volume, color, and even the transformation of various objects, animals, and people. How do magicians manage all this? It is very simple, because a magician is a creative person who always strives for something new and constantly improves his skills. An illusionist is a wonderful artist who can create complex technical tricks, easily present them on stage, improvise and surprise the audience with talent and illusions. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nMay miracles come with You!"
