But it awakens your body and your mind. So it can be enriching and satisfying. Riding a bike isn the only method to do this. any scenario that gets you moving and thinking would work. What do you like to do? how to make your life better maybe even the lives of others? It doesn endure much. Do something which gets you moving and thinking every day, And I promise you are able to feel better for it."
