Steed and his wife Karen were found dead. (Photo: Chris Sweda/Citizen-Times)\n\nIn a small Ohio town, a nurse was killed in his nursing home.\n\nPolice are still looking for the cause of the June 19 death of Dr. Donald M. Steed, 74, and his wife Karen.\n\nSteed was found dead in a closet. His name does not appear on the property tax deed, though it is listed as the nursing home's address on the back of the utility bill.\n\nA neighbor, who declined to give his name, said Steed spent time in the home recently after his wife retired. His death was not related to her illness, he said. He said he first noticed Steed was missing after he got home on Tuesday. Steed had a large amount of his belongings in the house.\n\n\"They were all neatly in front of their bed,\" the neighbor said. \"Then the lady in charge of (Steed's) care put her purse in the car and she went out.\"\n\nThe neighbor said he noticed Steed had \"nothing on his body.\"\n\nPolice said the nurse is not believed to have been poisoned. Steed and his wife had been married 51 years, according to property records at the nursing home.\n\nThe nursing home said it is cooperating with authorities and that it is taking steps to ensure security for nursing home patients and staff at the home.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2i9L8Pn"
