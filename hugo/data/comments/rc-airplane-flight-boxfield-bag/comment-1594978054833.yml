Police discovered the taxi where the attacks took place.\n\nThe woman had a cut on her head, and a wound that was deep enough to send blood up the back of her neck.\n\nImage caption The woman had a cut on her head, a wound that was deep enough to send blood up the back of her neck\n\nMs Patel suffered \"significant\" injuries to her nose, upper lip and the inside of her mouth.\n\nDet Supt Mark Stoner said she had already complained about police not responding to her complaints - and that despite the court ruling, her allegations would not be taken seriously again.\n\nDet Supt Stoner said Ms Patel has been told to seek a retrial in the new trial, and she now has another month to appeal.\n\n'I'd rather be dead'\n\nMs Patel, 38, who was wearing a sleeveless navy blue dress shirt and matching blue blazer, described how Ms Siah asked the two women to \"stay away from me because I wouldn't be here for them.\"\n\nImage caption The court heard Ms Patel suffered serious injuries to her nose\n\nShe added: \"I tried to tell them that I was tired. I'd rather be dead and didn't wanna hurt anyone.\"\n\nMs Patel said she wanted a new trial because the officers were \"scared to death\" after the two women tried to attack her.\n\nDet Supt Stoner said Ms Siah has been arrested three times before in the past three years - and four other men have been accused.\n\nHe said he did not think she was capable of threatening those who were investigating her.\n\nShe is also appealing against the sentence which she received. \r\n[url=https://www.shamsbim.com/]온라인카지노[/url]"
