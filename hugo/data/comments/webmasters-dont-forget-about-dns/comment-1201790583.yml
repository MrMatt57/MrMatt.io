    <p>@Steve P. - I am using vanity name servers at <a href="http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/u/39743" rel="nofollow noopener">DNS Made Easy</a>.  I wish I had the infrastructure to run five geo-redundant DNS servers.</p><p>All you have to do is register as a host so the TLD recognize them as valid name servers.</p>
