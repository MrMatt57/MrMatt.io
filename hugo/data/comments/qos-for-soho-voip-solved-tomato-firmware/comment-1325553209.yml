    <p>Hi, I have Tomato firmware running smoothly for a long time, but whenever China apps such as PPTV and PPStream are running elsewhere on the network, my Skype would suffer.</p><p>Is there a simple "Prioritise Skype Over Other Software" GUI manager add-on that can be added to Tomato to auto-prioritise Skype?</p><p>If not, how can I do so from the Tomato webadmin interface?</p><p>Thanks for advice!</p>
