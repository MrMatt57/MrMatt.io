message: "How do I delete the words “Archives for” in my categories? It only shows up in the first page of a category but not the succeeding pages. “Archives for” also appears in the search results. So instead of just showing “Japanese Cars” it will say “Archives for Japanese Cars”.\r\n312749 http://1hmjt.alicheapbuy.com"
