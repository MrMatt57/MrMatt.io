    <p>@Dimitrios - I have found when setting up Tomato classifications, simple is almost always better.  If you don't need granular filters,  don't set them.  For some reason they don't always work as expected.  QOS seems to be more of an art than a science.  All you can really do is use the real-time monitors until you find that magic combination that works for your traffic.  Port 5060 is for SIP traffic, don't forget the RTP ports.  You may have success using just the L7.  How is the quality for your voice calls?  Can you run all four at the same time?</p><p>I would run a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute" rel="nofollow noopener">trace route</a> on your server in California and see where your latency is.  You will likely find it is with your ISP and for the most part out of your control, but you might get lucky.  Another neat way to check global latency is with <a href="http://just-ping.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">just-ping.com</a> (you must have IMCP enabled).  If this isn't the issue, it definitely a bandwidth issue.  If your CRM has heavy graphics you could try local caching or any number of proxy servers/internet accelerators.</p><p>Another thing to check is your bandwidth utilization overall.  If you are not running pedal to metal QOS isn't going to help much.  It doesn't really speed things up, it is more for bandwidth allocation.  On the other-hand, if you are constantly maxed out, prioritizing your traffic will help... but you might ultimately need to consider upgrading your connection.</p><p>Anyone else have some advise?</p>
