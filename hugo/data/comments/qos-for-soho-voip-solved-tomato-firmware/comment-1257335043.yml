    <p>So many QoS implementations use bandwidth caps.  This is unintuitive and sacrificial.  Can't we just have a basic prioritization without limiting bandwidth of other services during off-peak periods?  For instance, during a phone call I don't care if all other traffic grinds to a halt.  In the same sense I'm perfectly OK with BitTorrent saturating my network while I'm not at home.</p>
