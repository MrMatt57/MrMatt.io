message: "I dreamed that I was walking next to a beautiful, huge chestnut horse. As we were getting closer to the stables I saw a man hitting a horse, also a chestnut, the horse was on it’s hind legs trying to pull free. Then suddenly the horse lay down on it’s side. Blood was flowing from it’s side. I was shocked at what I saw and started running towards the stables, shouting at the man to stop and saw that there were 3 horse’s lying on their sides with blood streaming out the wounds. When I reached the horses I was relieved to see that they were stil alive and that I could still help them. Then I woke up.\r\nh.sallow.co http://h.sallow.co/3fvn/"
