message: "Yes, that’s what a successful ClickBank product can generate and what affiliates who are promoting those products can make. \r\n \r\nThe ClickBank Marketplace tells the story. \r\n \r\nNow before I go further, let me say this: \r\n \r\nThese kinds of results are NOT TYPICAL. \r\n \r\nIn other words, please don't interpret any of this email as some sort of promise or implication of your future earnings. \r\n \r\nWhy? It’s the same reason an average person who buys home exercise equipment rarely ends up looking like the person in the infomercials. \r\n \r\nI’m not sure quite why that is, but I think it's safe to assume it's true across the board. \r\n \r\nHere's the bottom line: \r\n \r\nCreating an online business is HARD. And it takes WORK. On top of that, few things ever work right the first time. \r\n \r\nYou've got to stick with it. \r\n \r\nThink about it. If business was easy, everybody would be rich, wouldn’t they? \r\n \r\nThat’s why it’s EVEN MORE CRITICAL you get trained by experts who have a proven success specifically on ClickBank. \r\n \r\nThat’s why we encourage all our subscribers trying to make an online income to attend [url=https://webbyt.co/5yc20]    ClickBank University 2.0.[/url] \r\n \r\nWith ClickBank University 2.0 training, the odds of you being successful online developing or promoting ClickBank products go up DRAMATICALLY. \r\n \r\nWhy? \r\n \r\nBecause the training is MADE by ClickBank. \r\n \r\nThey’ve distilled their clients’ success principles, strategies and tactics... \r\n \r\n… whether you want to be a ClickBank product developer or an affiliate... \r\n \r\n… down to a series of proven blueprints, roadmaps and formulas. \r\n \r\nShared by other ClickBank developers and affiliates who were successful. \r\n \r\nThe good news is [url=https://webbyt.co/5yc20] ClickBank University enrollment[/url] is now open. And I encourage you to attend while you can. \r\n \r\nIn the beginning, it could make the difference between a [url=https://webbyt.co/5yc20] $1,000 month and a $10,000 month.[/url]"
