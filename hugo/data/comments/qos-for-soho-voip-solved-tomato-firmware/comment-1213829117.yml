    <p>What is the I7-filter?  What does it do?</p><p>I have a small office, 4 computers, all have softphones.  I want to prioritize the VOIP traffic.   We do not have any heavy downloads, no P2P  or any of that stuff..our CRM is web based, so the 2 main things we use our internet for are calls and using the CRM.</p><p>Anyone have any tips for maximizing my set up?</p><p>Thanks!</p>
